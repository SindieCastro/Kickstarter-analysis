# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Performing analysis of Kickstarter data to uncover trends

### **Findings**

1. Filtering for only the United States campaigns, we found that there were 525 successful theater Kickstarters.

2. We have found that while there are only a total of 604 Kickstarter campaigns for plays in Great Britain, the "theater" category is the most successful.

3. The month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns was May. However, January, June, July and October all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched.

4. The Foresight campaign was successful. It reached 100% of its goal -- it even went over by four dollars! The average donation is surprisingly high, considering there are only 17 backers. Scrolling further, we can also see that the campaign wasn't active for very long---just under a month.

5. Failed Kickstarter campaigns have much higher fundraising goals than successful Kickstarter campaigns. 

6. In addition, the mean and median pledged amounts are much lower than the successful pledges, which indicates that failed Kickstarter campaigns are unsuccessful for reasons other than asking for too much money. In other words, if the failed projects were also getting a median pledge amount of around $3,000, it's possible that those that failed just asked for too high of a price. Since the median is much lower, there must be another factor keeping people from pledging to those unsuccessful projects. 

7. Based on these statistics, we can determine the following:

   1.  The mean of each distribution is around the 3rd quartile, so the data follows similar distributions in each subset.

   2.   The standard deviations are larger than the mean, which means everything below the mean is considered "close" to the center.

   3.  Some large values are driving all of these distributions. The standard deviations are all roughly twice the IQR in each distribution, except in the failed Kickstarters, where the standard deviation is closer to three times the IQR. There must be some failed Kickstarters with really high goals!

8. The mean campaign goal to kickstar a musical in Great Britain is around £4,000. This is outside of the range of outliers for the amount pledged. Also, half of the campaign goals are less than £2,000, which is just over the 3rd quartile for amounts pledged.
